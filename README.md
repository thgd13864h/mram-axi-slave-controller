Performance Summary
-------------------
This fork includes cycle-level performance estimates derived directly from RTL parameters.

- Clock: 100 MHz, AXI 64-bit
- MRAM write delay: write_delay_config = 8
- MRAM read latency: READ_LAT = 2

Write bandwidth ≈ 80 MB/s  
Read bandwidth ≈ 267 MB/s  

A 4-beat write + 4-beat read MCU transaction transfers 64 bytes in ~52 cycles
(~520 ns), resulting in an effective payload bandwidth of ~123 MB/s.

Detailed derivations and example calculations are provided in
`Fork_Performance.md`.

MRAM AXI Slave Controller
=========================

This repository provides documentation and a reference SystemVerilog implementation
related to an MRAM-based AXI slave controller and its role in SoC-level architecture.

The materials in this repository are intended for public reference, technical
explanation, and design documentation. All files are published to provide a
verifiable, timestamped public record of the work.

RTL Structure
-------------
The design is organized into the following key components:

- `mcu_axi_master_model.sv`  
  Behavioral AXI master modeling basic MCU-style read/write traffic.

- `dma_axi_master_model.sv`  
  Behavioral AXI master modeling DMA-style memory access.

- `axi_noc_2m2s.sv`  
  AXI interconnect providing arbitration and address decoding between masters
  and slave subsystems.

- `axi_mram_slave.sv`  
  AXI slave controller interfacing with the MRAM model.

- `mram_model.sv`  
  Behavioral MRAM macro model used for functional simulation.

- `axi_ram_slave_model.sv`  
  Simple SRAM-backed AXI slave model.

- `soc_top_2m2s_noc_mram.sv`  
  Top-level SoC integration connecting all masters, interconnect, and slaves.


Repository Contents
